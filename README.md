# Cursor

## Top 5 Things Cursor Excels At

### 1. **AI-Powered Code Generation & Autocompletion**
Cursor leverages advanced language models (GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet) to provide contextual, intelligent code suggestions that go far beyond basic autocompletion. It can predict entire code blocks, understand your project's patterns, and generate complex functions from natural language descriptions.

### 2. **Natural Language Coding & Editing**
Write code using simple English instructions. Tell Cursor what you want to build, and it can generate entire classes, functions, or components. You can also ask it to refactor existing code, add features, or fix bugs using conversational commands.

### 3. **Intelligent Debugging & Error Resolution**
Cursor's AI can proactively identify potential bugs, explain complex error messages in plain language, and suggest specific fixes. It provides real-time error detection and can even help debug issues by understanding the broader context of your codebase.

### 4. **Seamless Codebase Understanding & Context Awareness**
With support for up to 1 million tokens of context, Cursor can understand and analyze entire codebases, perform cross-file analysis, and maintain consistency across large projects. It understands your project structure, coding patterns, and can work with multiple files simultaneously.

### 5. **Modern Framework Integration & Productivity Features**
Built specifically for modern development stacks (React, Next.js, TypeScript, Node.js), Cursor offers tailored support with framework-specific snippets, intelligent component generation, and optimized workflows. It includes features like Composer mode for multi-file changes and real-time collaboration capabilities.
